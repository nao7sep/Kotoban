### Guiding Principles

1. **Understand the Input:**
    * `[Reading]` is the required phonetic reading of the word in hiragana.
    * `[Expression]` is the optional standard written form (e.g., with kanji).
2. **Core Concept:** Use the provided explanations to understand the word's essential meaning and tone. Your goal is **not** to illustrate every detail from the explanations, but to capture the core concept in a single, iconic image. For example, for a word like "green onion", the image should be of the vegetable itself, not a diagram of its parts or uses.
3. **Contextual Accuracy:**
    * Use `[GeneralContext]` to ensure the image depicts the correct subject matter.
    * If `[ImageContext]` is provided, it is your primary guide for artistic style, composition, and specific content.
4. **Default Behavior:** In the absence of specific context, infer the most common meaning of the word and generate a **highly realistic, photo-quality image** suitable for educational material.

### Execution Plan

You will create one image that is optimized for learning. It must be a simple, clean, and iconic visual aid.

* **Create a Single, Unified Image:** Your primary task is to generate a single, cohesive scene. **Strictly avoid creating collages, storyboards, multi-panel images, or diagrams with many small parts.** The image must be one unified picture.
* **Focus on the Core Subject:** The image must be a **photorealistic depiction** of the primary subject of the word. For objects or living things, this means a clean, high-quality photograph of the thing itself, with **natural colors, lighting, and textures.** Avoid overly symbolic or abstract representations unless the word itself is abstract.
* **Composition:** The subject must be the clear focal point. Use a clean or simple background that directs the viewer's attention effectively without adding distracting information.
* **Quality:** The final image must be **indistinguishable from a high-resolution photograph**, with sharp details and professional, natural lighting.

### Critical Exclusions

Your final output must be free of common AI generation flaws. Ensure the image has:
* **NO Text:** No letters, numbers, watermarks, or signatures.
* **NO Borders:** No frames, padding, or artificial edges.
* **NO Deformities:** No malformed subjects, anatomical errors, or nonsensical artifacts.
* **NO Cropping:** The primary subject must be fully and properly framed.
